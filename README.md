hi there! I recently completed an MS in Environmental Health at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and am now working in the public sector as a Presidential Management Fellow. My master's work was at the intersection of environmental geochemistry + public health, focused on addressing environmental health disparities through community-based participatory research and evidence-based decision-making. I seek out projects that serve the dual purpose of generating new scientific knowledge and addressing community concerns. I primarily use R for my data analysis work and leverage Shiny apps for interactive data visualization and communication projects. I'm always on the hunt for new (accessible!) tools for organizing, collaborating, designing, etc. 

#### I'm currently working on: 

üóìÔ∏è [Amanda's 2023 wRapped](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF5ZyHZch8/W6Gj-yKtagMely3yAPr5pQ/edit?utm_content=DAF5ZyHZch8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) -- think Spotify wrapped but for R!

üìù I'm excited to introduce others to R and break down barriers to applied data science. I've served as an advisor/consultant for research projects, supported a data management course designed for public health researchers, and hosted a few R workshops on my own; You can find my collection of R and data communication/visualization resources on Notion: [https://amandabhernandez.notion.site/R-resources](https://amandabhernandez.notion.site/R-resources-df2ced5246924d00818de42904df3ed3)

#### Past projects: 

üö∞ Digital tools for Massachusetts residents who rely on a public water system for their drinking water and are concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and contaminants identified by EPA to increase the risk of cancer for long-term exposure above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)

  - PFAS live site: [https://abhz.shinyapps.io/My-PFAS-Water-Report/](https://abhz.shinyapps.io/My-PFAS-Water-Report/) 


üìà Interactive dashboards for displaying indoor air quality monitoring -- the first is a dashboard for a monitor I had in my apartment for a few months and the second is a simple dashboard for an exposure assessment in a Somerville, MA microbrewery
  - IAQ Explorer dashboard: [https://abhz.shinyapps.io/airthings_iaq_explorer/](https://abhz.shinyapps.io/airthings_iaq_explorer/)
