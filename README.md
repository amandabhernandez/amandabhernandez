hi there! I'm a first-year MS Candidate in Environmental Health at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. My work is focused on addressing environmental health disparities through community-based participatory research. I seek out projects that serve the dual purpose of generating new scientific knowledge and addressing community concerns. I primarily use R for my data analysis work, and recently began learning to create Shiny apps for interactive data visualization and communication projects. I'm always on the hunt for new tools for organizing, collaborating, sharing, etc.

### I'm currently working on: 

- 🚰 A a digital report tool for Massachusetts residents who rely on a public water system for their drinking water and are concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 
  - Live site: [https://abhz.shinyapps.io/My-PFAS-Water-Report/](https://abhz.shinyapps.io/My-PFAS-Water-Report/)
  - Repo: [https://github.com/amandabhernandez/PFAS-in-MA-DW](https://github.com/amandabhernandez/PFAS-in-MA-DW)


- 📝 My collection of R and data communication resources using Notion: [https://amandabhernandez.notion.site/R-resources](https://amandabhernandez.notion.site/R-resources-df2ced5246924d00818de42904df3ed3)


- A series of R workshops! I'm excited to introduce others to R and break down barriers to applied data science. I'm working on turning my workshop slides into a learnR tutorial geared towards environmental health scientists.
