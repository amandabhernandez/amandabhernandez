hi there! I'm a second-year MS Candidate in Environmental Health at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. My work is at the intersection of environmental geochemistry and public health, focused on addressing environmental health disparities through community-based participatory research and evidence-based decision-making. I seek out projects that serve the dual purpose of generating new scientific knowledge and addressing community concerns. I primarily use R for my data analysis work and leverage Shiny apps for interactive data visualization and communication projects. I'm always on the hunt for new (accessible!) tools for organizing, collaborating, designing, etc. 

#### I'm currently working on: 

üö∞ Digital report tools for Massachusetts residents who rely on a public water system for their drinking water and are concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and contaminants identified by EPA to increase the risk of cancer for long-term exposure above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) 
  - PFAS live site: [https://abhz.shinyapps.io/My-PFAS-Water-Report/](https://abhz.shinyapps.io/My-PFAS-Water-Report/)
  -  PFAS repository: [https://github.com/amandabhernandez/PFAS-in-MA-DW](https://github.com/amandabhernandez/PFAS-in-MA-DW)

üìà An interactive dashboard for an indoor air quality monitor I had in my apartment for a few months

üìù My collection of R and data communication/visualization resources on Notion: [https://amandabhernandez.notion.site/R-resources](https://amandabhernandez.notion.site/R-resources-df2ced5246924d00818de42904df3ed3)


üíª A series of R workshops! I'm excited to introduce others to R and break down barriers to applied data science. I've served as an advisor/consultant for research projects and hosted a few R workshops; I'm working on turning my workshop slides into a learnR tutorial geared towards environmental health scientists. Stay tuned!
